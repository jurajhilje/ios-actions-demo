# Security Policy

## Reporting a security vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, **DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE**. Instead, please send an email to juraj.hilje@gmail.com.

## Incident resolution process

After this type of report has been submitted, a security vulnerability will be privately discussed, fixed and then publicly disclosed in a security advisory, involving the following steps:

* Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.   
* Audit code to find any potential similar problems.  
* Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible.  
* Publicly disclose security problem in a security advisory.
